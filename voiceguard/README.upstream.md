# **VoiceGuard: Real-Time Voice Phishing Detection using RawNet**

## 📋 **Overview**
VoiceGuard is an AI-powered system designed to detect voice phishing using a deep learning-based model, **RawNet**. The system utilizes advanced signal processing techniques, attention mechanisms, and GRU layers to accurately classify audio samples as either real or synthesized. This tool can be applied to protect users from malicious voice-based attacks, especially in phone conversations or online communications.

---

## 🛠 **Features**
- **Binary Classification**: Distinguishes between real human voices and synthesized ones (i.e., fake).
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Identifies specific voice synthesis techniques (e.g., WaveGrad, DiffWave, MelGAN).
- **Efficient Feature Extraction**: Utilizes Mel-spectrogram, MFCCs, and other audio features for robust analysis.
- **Mobile Deployment**: Supports model quantization for mobile deployment, reducing model size and inference time.

## **Install dependencies**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
🚀 Training the Model
Step 1: Configure the model
Edit the model_config_RawNet.yaml file to set up your model parameters.
```
python train.py --data_path ./dataset --batch_size 64 --num_epochs 50 --lr 0.0001 --model_save_path ./checkpoints
```
Parameters:

- --data_path: Path to your dataset.
- --batch_size: Batch size for training.
-  --num_epochs: Number of epochs to train.
-  --lr: Learning rate.
-  --model_save_path: Directory to save the trained models.
  
🧪 Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of your trained model, use the eval.py script:
```
python eval.py --input_path path/to/audio.wav --model_path checkpoints/epoch_best_model.pth
```
